## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, send me a DM on X (formerly Twitter). My handle is the same as my GitHub account name. You can expect a reply within 48 hours. Depending on the complexity of the fix, I can either fix it directly or plan the fix. I will let you know when the fix is planned and when it is implemented.
