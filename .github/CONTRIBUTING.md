# How to contribute

This repository is open to contributions. Any useful scripts to administer Azure DevOps Services/Server or even TFS are welcome. Technologies used are mainly PowerShell and T-SQL, but other technologies can be used as well. Contributions can be made through Pull Requests. Please include a clear list of what you've done. Maybe include an example call to the script as well. We prefer atomic commits (one feature per commit).

If you have questions, please contact me on Twitter [@FokkoVeegens](https://twitter.com/FokkoVeegens) via DM.
